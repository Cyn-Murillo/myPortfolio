            <p className="about-content">Hello! I'm Cynthia Murillo. I'm currently pursuing a B.S. in Information Science and Data Analytics at San Jos√© State University, and I have a passion for building robust and responsive applications. I consider myself a resilient and persevering Junior Developer with experience in Python, SQL and C++. A motivated self-starter who wants to continue growing my skills and abilities in current and new technologies. An open-minded and adroit problem-solver with the ability to self-manage whether it be in independent projects or within a team setting. A lot of my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills have been acquired through web searches, codecademy, SoloLearn App courses, and some course work. My goal is not only to create PRETTY webpages but most importantly functional, responsive web pages to create the best user interface and user experience. My path in software and web development is still being paved. Although I have learned a lot over the last years, I know I will continue learning and growing through out my career.</p>
